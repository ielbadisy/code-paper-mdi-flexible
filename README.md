# Simulation Code for MDI in Flexible Survival Models


Code and scripts for the simulation study in the paper **"A comparison of Classical and Machine Learning-Based Missing Data Imputation Methods in Flexible Survival Models with Time-Varying and Non-Linear Covariate Effects"**.

## Overview

This repository contains:

* **Simulation scripts** for generating survival datasets under MCAR, MAR, and MNAR mechanisms.
* **Model fitting functions** for flexible survival models with proportional hazards (PH), time-varying effects (TVE) and non-linear (NLE) effects.
* **Evaluation routines** for bias, mean squared error (MSE), and empirical coverage.
